Step 1) Run ./initial-clone from the top level

Step 2) Add additional remotes, if desired, to the repositories inside compiler/

Step 3) Create your build directory, such as `mybuild`

Step 4) `cd mybuild` with your chosen build directory

Step 5) Run `cmake ..` with your desired options, for instance:

        * `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
          to choose the type of build

        * `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/prefix` to install in a local
          tree.

        * `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++` to change
          the compiler used.

Step 6) make # Parallel builds tested up to -j30

Running ./update will pull all cloned repositories in compiler.
